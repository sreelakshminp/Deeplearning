1.Problem Statement The task is to classify images from the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0–9) using deep learning techniques. The goal is to train a neural network that can accurately predict the digit shown in an image.

2.Deep Learning Methods The project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are widely used for image classification tasks because they automatically extract spatial features like edges, shapes, and textures from images.

3.Description of Methods Data Preprocessing MNIST dataset is loaded, containing 28x28 grayscale digit images. Pixel values are normalized to improve training efficiency.

CNN Architecture Convolutional layers extract local image features. Pooling layers reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important information. Fully connected (dense) layers interpret these features for classification. Softmax activation is used in the final layer to output probabilities for each digit (0–9).

Training Process The dataset is split into training and test sets. Model is trained using backpropagation with an optimizer (e.g., Adam). Loss function used is categorical cross-entropy. Methods Applied to Solve the Problem Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Used to extract features and classify digits. Dropout Regularization: Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training. Activation Functions (ReLU & Softmax): Provide non-linearity and probability outputs.

4.Result The model achieves high accuracy (typically above 98%) on the MNIST test dataset, showing that CNNs are effective for digit recognition tasks.

5.Conclusion This project demonstrates the application of CNNs for handwritten digit classification. The results confirm that deep learning methods can achieve excellent performance on image recognition problems, and similar techniques can be extended to more complex datasets in real-world applications.
