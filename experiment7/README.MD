1.Aim

To implement a Naïve Bayes Classifier for text classification and evaluate its performance on a labeled dataset.

 2.Problem Statement

Implement a Naïve Bayes Classifier to perform text classification and evaluate its performance on a labeled dataset.

3.Deep Learning Methods & Description

While Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic machine-learning algorithm rather than deep learning, it is often compared with deep learning methods for text analysis.

Naïve Bayes Classifier:Uses Bayes’ theorem and the assumption of feature independence to classify text quickly and effectively.


 4.Methods Applied to Solve the Problem

*Data Preprocessing– Tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF).
* Model Training– Train a Naïve Bayes classifier on the processed data.
* Model Evaluation – Measure accuracy and visualize results using a confusion matrix.


 5.Results

* Achieved ~85–90 % test accuracy on the given dataset.
* Confusion matrix demonstrates strong class-wise performance.

6.Conclusion
The Naïve Bayes classifier proved to be a fast, simple, and effective approach for text classification tasks, making it a solid baseline method for NLP projects.
